Astral is a 3D SDF modeling application that bridges the gap between traditional vertex-based modeling and modern Signed Distance Field (SDF) techniques. It combines the flexibility and control of classical modeling with the non-destructive, topology-free advantages of SDF workflows. With Astral, you can create and modify complex shapes without worrying about topology or shading errorsâ€”while still retaining the precision and control that professional artists and designers expect. Change anything at any time, and keep your creative process fluid and intuitive.
